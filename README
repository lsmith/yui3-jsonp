Module 'jsonp'.

Provides class Y.JSONPRequest to encapsulate JSONP requests.  The send() method issues the JSONP request, and can be used multiple times if you want to poll a source (the Twitter API for example).

Also provides a convenience method Y.jsonp(url,c) which creates an instance and calls send() immediately, returning the JSONPRequest instance.
